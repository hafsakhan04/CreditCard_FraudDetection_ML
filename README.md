Welcome to the "Credit Card Fraud Detection Models" repository! This repository contains the implementation of several machine learning models and deep learning models for credit card fraud detection, using the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. Below, you'll find information about the models included and how to use them.

## Models Included
1. **Logistic Regression:** A baseline logistic regression model for fraud detection.
2. **XGBoost:** An ensemble model using XGBoost for improved accuracy.
3. **Decision Tree:** A decision tree classifier for detecting fraud.
4. **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** A Support Vector Machine model for classification.
5. **Stacking Model:** A stacked ensemble model combining multiple base models, XGBoost,Logistic regression, Random Forest for enhanced performance.
6. **CatBoost:** A gradient boosting model from CatBoost library.
7. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** A deep learning model for fraud detection using convolutional layers.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
`bash
git clone https://github.com/hafsakhan04/CreditCard_FraudDetection_ML.git

Install the required libraries. You can use pip to install them:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.
Navigate to the specific model's directory and run the corresponding Python script to train and evaluate the model.
